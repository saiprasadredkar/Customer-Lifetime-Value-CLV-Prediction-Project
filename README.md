#Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Project
Understanding customer value is crucial for businesses looking to maximize revenue and long-term growth. In this project, I built a predictive model for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to help companies identify their most valuable customers and optimize marketing strategies!
About the Project -
    The goal was to analyze customer purchasing behavior and predict their future value, allowing businesses to focus on high-value customers and improve retention efforts.
Key Steps in the Project:
 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handled missing values, converted categorical data, and ensured data consistency.
 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyzed trends like purchase frequency, average transaction value, and customer segmentation.
 3️⃣ Feature Engineering – Created meaningful features such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores to enhance prediction accuracy.
 4️⃣ Model Building – Trained models like Random Forest to predict CLV.
 5️⃣ Model Evaluation – Used metrics like R-squared, MAE, and RMSE to assess model performance and fine-tune results.
📊 Key Insights Gained:
 ✅ High purchase frequency customers contribute significantly to CLV.
 ✅ Loyal customers tend to have a higher predicted CLV than one-time buyers.
 ✅ Discount-driven customers often have lower CLV, indicating the importance of personalized retention strategies.
 ✅ Segmentation helps businesses allocate marketing budgets effectively based on predicted CLV.
💻 Tools Used:
 Python 🐍 | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Random Forest
This project deepened my understanding of customer behavior analytics and how businesses can leverage data to boost revenue and enhance retention strategies.
